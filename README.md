# Assignments

The learnings and key takeaways of the chapters, as well as the short description of the additional learning projects can be found in "learning journal central document"

These are just assignments for a university course 
I mostly converted them into py files, because I was able to take a closer look at the classes, variables and used source code of external libraries

Note: the biggest project of mine is the code of the Tinderbot is not here because I decided it should not be publicly available (due to the destructive nature of the project)

Added jupyters at a later point for completion
