# Assignments

The learnings and key takeaways of the chapters, as well as the short description of the additional learning projects can be found in "learning journal central document"

These are just assignments for a university course 
I mostly converted them into py files, because I was able to take a closer look at the classes, variables and used source code of external libraries.

Note: the biggest project of mine is the code of the Tinderbot is not here because I decided it should not be publicly available (due to the destructive nature of the project)
You can find the presentation in here, but I sent you the code via Email. 

Added jupyters at a later point for completion.

I also added a short description of the project that I did with Bitcoin. The document is called "Algorithms against the market" where used multiple models to power a trading bot.
