# Assignments

These are just assignments for a university course 
I mostly converted them into py files, because I was able to take a closer look at the classes, variables and used source code of external libraries

Note: the biggest project of mine is the code of the Tinderbot is not here because I decided it should not be publicly available (due to the destructive nature of the project)
